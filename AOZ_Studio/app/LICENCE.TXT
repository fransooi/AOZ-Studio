Introduction
------------
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. Using the GNU GPL will require that all the released improved versions be free software. This means you can avoid the risk of having to compete with a proprietary modified version of your own work.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works, by contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program to make sure it remains free software for all its users. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

A crucial aspect of free software is that users are free to cooperate. It is absolutely essential to permit users who wish to help each other to share their bug fixes and improvements with other users. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: 
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and 
 (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
