<i>Dev Open</i>
<b>Dev Open</b> xxxxxxx
=
The DEV OPEN command opens a communication port and prepares the device for use by AOZ
programs. If this device is not already installed, it will be loaded from the "DEVS" folder of your current start-up
disc automatically. Floppy disc users may be requested to swap discs at this point.

The selected device will now remain active during the course of the program, and will only be closed if a DEV
CLOSE command is called, or a RUN command is used to clear the variable area, or a CLEAR operation is
undertaken.

The specified channel number should be from zero to 4, the "name.device" parameter enters the name of the device
to be initialised in normal AmigaDOS format, and IOlength specified the length of the IO structure to be created for
the device. If in doubt, use a value of 256, which should be sufficient for most devices. The final flags parameter
sets the status of the device flags if applicable. Please refer to your system documentation for details.

DEV OPEN performs the following operations:

- Firstly, a communication port is created and initialised.
- Next, an IO Ext structure is opened, ready for communication.
- Lastly, the OPEN DEVICE function is executed with the new structure.
