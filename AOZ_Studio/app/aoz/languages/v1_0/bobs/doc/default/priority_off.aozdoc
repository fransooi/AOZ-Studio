<i>Priority Off</i>

When PRIORITY ON is used, Bobs with the highest y-coordinates take priority on the screen.
It is usually best to set hot spots at the bottom of Bobs to exploit this priority, and some superb perspective effects can be created.

All that is needed to re-set the original Bob number priorities is to use the PRIORITY OFF command.
