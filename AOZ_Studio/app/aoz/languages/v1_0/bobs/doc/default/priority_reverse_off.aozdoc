<i>Priority Reverse Off</i>
<b>Priority Reverse Off</b> xxxxxxx

The PRIORITY REVERSE ON command changes around the entire priority table based on Bob numbers. Not only does it give a lower Bob number priority over a higher Bob number, when used with PRIORITY ON it also gives
priority to a Bob with the lowest y-coordinate. As you would expect, PRIORITY REVERSE OFF sets the priority
system back to normal.
