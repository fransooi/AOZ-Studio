Use this command to remove all Bobs from the screen simultaneously. If the index of a Bob is specified, only that Bob will be extinguished. For example:
@code
Bob Off 1: 			// Remove Bob 1 only
Bob Off "mybob" 	// remove Bob "mybob" only
Bob Off 			// Remove all Bobs from screen
@code
The BOB OFF instruction also turns off any animation or collision routines associated with these Bobs.
