<i>Bob Move On</i>
<b>Bob Move On</b> xxxxxxx

Before any movement patterns can be executed, they must be activated by a BOB MOVE ON command. All movements
will begin at once unless an optional number is given, in which case only that particular animation sequence will be
activated. BOB MOVE OFF has the opposite effect, halting all animations, or a single sequence specified by its number.
