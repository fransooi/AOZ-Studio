<i>Ins Bob</i>
<b>Ins Bob</b> xxxxxxx
=
This version of the INS BOB instruction works like the version with only one parameter but inserts a series of blank image after the numbered position in the current Object Bank and not only one.
All of the images after this numbered position will then be moved down one place in the numerical order.
