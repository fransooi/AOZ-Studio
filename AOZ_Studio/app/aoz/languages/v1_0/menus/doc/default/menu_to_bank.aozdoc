<i>Menu To Bank</i>
<b>Menu To Bank</b> xxxxxxx
=
Use this command to save your menu along with its entire structure of branch definitions to the numbered bank.
Once the menu has been stored in the selected memory bank, it will automatically be saved along with your Basic
program. By storing your menu definitions in a memory bank, the size of your program listings are reduced
significantly, freeing valuable space in the editor memory. If the bank number you select already exists, the
appropriate error message will be given.
