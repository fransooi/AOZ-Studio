To activate the automatic menu system created by the ON MENU PROC, GOSUB or GOTO commands, simply
give the ON MENU ON command. After a subroutine has been accessed in this way, the system is automatically
disabled. Therefore you must reactivate the system with ON MENU ON before returning to the main program.
