It is not difficult to find which colours are occupying the colour index, and analyse how much Red, Green and Blue is used to make up each shade.
The COLOR function can take an index number from 0 to 31, and returns the colour value assigned to that number. Hex$ is used for this purpose, as follows
@code
For C=0 To 15: Ink C
Print Hex$(Color(C),3)
Circle 160,75,(C+1)*4
Next C
@code
