<i>Shift Down</i>
<b>Shift Down</b> xxxxxxx
=
This command is identical to SHIFT UP, except for the fact that colours are rotated in the opposite direction, so that
the second colour is copied into the first, the third to the second, and so on. With the final flag set to zero, all colours
are eventually replaced with the last colour in the list
