<i>Set Equate Bank</i>
<b>Set Equate Bank</b> xxxxxxx
=
(extracted from the AMOSPro manual)

This command allocates a memory bank for use by the automatic equate system. It should be called up before the
first equate in your program, preferably near the beginning. Specify the bank number to be used for your equates,
ranging from 1 to 65535. Any existing bank of the same number will be erased when the equates are installed in
memory, without warning, so take care!
