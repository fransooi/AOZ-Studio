(extracted from the AMOSPro manual)

One characteristic of mobile menus is that the amount of memory they use changes during the course of the
program. With large menus or programs that are on the boundary of available memory this can cause real problems.
MENU STATIC can be used to avoid these difficulties by setting the level or item at which the entire menu
becomes immovable by the user.
