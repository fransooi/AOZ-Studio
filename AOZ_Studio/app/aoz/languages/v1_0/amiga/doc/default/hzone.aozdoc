(extracted from the AMOSPro manual)

The HZONE function is identical to ZONE, except for the fact that the position on screen is measured in hardware
coordinates. This means that this function can be used to detect the presence of a hardware Sprite in one of the
screen zones, in this format:
@code
N=Hzone(X Sprite(n),Y Sprite(n))
@code
