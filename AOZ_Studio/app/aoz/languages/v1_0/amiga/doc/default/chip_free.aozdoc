For an example of a function in operation, the FREE function checks how many "bytes" of memory are currently
available to hold your variables, and it can be used to make a report, like this:
@code
Print "The number of bytes available is:;Free
@code
Now use the FREE function with the SET BUFFER command (which is explained earlier in this Chapter) as
follows:
@code
Set Buffer 13
Print "The number of bytes now available is:;Free
@code
