This instruction has no effect in AOZ and is left for compatibility with AMOS applications.

(extracted from the AMOSPro manual)

As you might expect, this command produces a list of the fonts that are built into the computer's ROM chips. At time of writing, the choice is rather limited:
@code
Screen Open 0,640,200,16,Hires
Get Rom Fonts
For A=1 To 10
Set Font A : A$="Hello, I'm "+ Font$(A) : Text 0,100,A$
Wait Key : Cls
Next A
@code
