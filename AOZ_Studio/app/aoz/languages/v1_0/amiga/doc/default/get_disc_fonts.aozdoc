This instruction has no effect in AOZ and is left for compatibility with AMOS applications.

(extracted from the AMOSPro manual)

This instruction is exactly the same as the GET FONTS command, except that it triggers a search through the Fonts" folder of your current disc only. If new fonts are to be used, then they must first be copied into this folder.
