<b>Resume</b> xxxxxxx

Used on its own, RESUME will jump back to the statement which caused the error and try it again. To return to the
instruction immediately after the one that caused the error, use RESUME NEXT. Alternatively, to jump to a specific
point in your main program, simply follow RESUME with a reference to a chosen label or a normal line number.

Warning: if you do not correct the cause of error, a new error will be generated, resumed, and your computer could go in a never-ending loop.
