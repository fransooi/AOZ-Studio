This instruction will force AOZ to make a jump when the user presses CONTROL-C... You can therefore prevent the user from leaving your application.

It can also be used to prevent CONTROL-C from breaking in order to use the combination of keys, for example to paste text in an editor.

For example:
@code
On Break Proc BROKEN
Do
Print "Unbroken" : Wait 50
Loop

Procedure BROKEN
Print "I am the procedure"
End Proc
