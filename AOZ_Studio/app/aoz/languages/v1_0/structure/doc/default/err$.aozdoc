<b>Err$</b> xxxxxxx
=
This simple function returns an error message string.
If the error number is out of range, then an empty string will be given.
ERR$ will return error messages as long as they are loaded in memory, but messages will not be returned from a compiled program, or if the Editor has been KILLed.
