Normally, the index counter is increased by 1 unit at every turn of a FOR ... NEXT loop. When the current value
exceeds that of the last number specified, the loop is terminated.

For example:
@code
For DAY=1 To 365
Print DAY
Next DAY
@code
STEP is used to change the size of increase in the index value, like this:
@code
For DAY=1 To 365 Step 7
Print DAY
Next DAY
@code
