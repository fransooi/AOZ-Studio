<i>CLine</i>
<b>CLine</b> xxxxxxx
=
This command is used to clear the line currently occupied by the text cursor. If CLINE is qualified by a number,
then that number of characters get cleared, starting from the current cursor position and leaving the cursor exactly
where it is. For example:
@code
Print "Testing Testing Testing";
Cmove -7,
Cline 7
Wait Key
Cline
@code
This instruction does not move the cursor.
