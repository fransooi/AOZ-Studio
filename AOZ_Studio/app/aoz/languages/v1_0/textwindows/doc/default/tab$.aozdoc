<i>Tab$</i>
<b>Tab$</b> xxxxxxx

The TAB$ function returns a special control character called TAB, which carries the Ascii code of 9. When this
character is printed, the text cursor is automatically moved to the next tabulated column setting (Tab) to the right.
The default setting for this is four characters, which can be changed with the SET TAB instruction.
