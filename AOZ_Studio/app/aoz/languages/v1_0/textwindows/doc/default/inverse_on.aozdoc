<i>Inverse On</i>
<b>Inverse On</b> xxxxxxx
=
The INVERSE instruction swaps over the text and background colours already selected by the PEN and PAPER
commands, and so sets up an inverse mode for printing. For example:
@code
Pen 2 : Paper 4: Print "I appear normal"
Inverse On : Print "Poetry inverse"
Inverse Off : Print "Don't be so negative"
@code
