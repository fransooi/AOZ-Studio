The SCROLL commands are used to control the scrolling of the current window. SCROLL OFF turns off the
scrolling, and whenever the cursor passes beyond the bottom of the window it will reappear from the top. SCROLL
ON starts the scrolling process again, so that a new line is inserted when the cursor tries to pass beyond the bottom
of the window.
