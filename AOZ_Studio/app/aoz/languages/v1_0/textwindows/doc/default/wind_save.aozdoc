<i>Wind Save</i>
<b>Wind Save</b> xxxxxxx

This command is extremely valuable for the AOZ Studio programmer. Once activated, the WIND SAVE
feature allows you to move your windows anywhere on screen without corrupting the existing display, by the
following method. The contents of the current window is saved as soon as the command is used, and then every
time a new window is opened, the contents of the windows underneath get saved automatically. The screen is then
re-drawn whenever a window is moved to a new position or closed.
