REV combines HREV and VREV into a single function. It takes the image whose number is held in brackets, reverses it from left to right and then performs another reversal from top to bottom. For example:
@code

Curs Off : Cls 0
Flash Off : Get Bob Palette
For Y=200 To -40 Step -1

For Y=-40 To 200
Bob 1,Y*2,Y,Rev(1)
Wait Vbl
