<i>Sprite Priority</i>
<b>Sprite Priority</b> xxxxxxx
=
When SPRITE PRIORITY ON is used, Sprites with the highest y-coordinates take priority on the screen.
It is usually best to set hot spots at the bottom of the Sprite to exploit this priority, and some superb perspective effects can be created.

All that is needed to re-set the original sprite number priorities is to use the SPRITE PRIORITY OFF command.
