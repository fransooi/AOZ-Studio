<i>Sprite Move On</i>

Before any movement patterns can be executed, they must be activated by a SPRITE MOVE ON command. All movements
will begin at once unless an optional number is given, in which case only that particular animation sequence will be
activated. SPRITE MOVE OFF has the opposite effect, halting all animations, or a single sequence specified by its number.
