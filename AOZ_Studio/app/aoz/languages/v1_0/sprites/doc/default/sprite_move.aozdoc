<i>Sprite Move</i>
<b>Sprite Move</b> xxxxxxx

The instruction has been added to AOZ to allow you to declare movement in just one instruction instead of two, namely "Sprite Move X" and "Sprite Move Y".

Each string contains the definition of the movement for it's axe. The syntax of the string is identical to the one used in "Sprite Move X" and "Sprite Move Y".
