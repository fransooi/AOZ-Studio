Do not confuse this with STR$, which converts numbers into a string.

The STRING$ function creates a new string filled with the required number of copies of the first character from an existing string.

For instance, the following example produces a new string containing ten copies of the character "A":
@code
Print String$("AMOS Professional is a joy forever",10)
