<i>Col</i>
<b>Col</b> xxxxxxx
=
One obvious problem with all of the previous detection functions is that they only report on whether an individual object has been hit.
To discover information about any other objects involved in a collision, the COL function is used. This means that each object can be tested on its own, to see if it has collided with the source object ""
Give the index of the object you wish to test, either a Bob or a Sprite, depending on the circumstances, and its status will be reported with a value of True if it has collided, or False if it remains untouched

Note that this function has been extended in AOZ, if you use -1 for this parameter, it will return the INDEX of the object in collision, to avoid having to perform a loop
