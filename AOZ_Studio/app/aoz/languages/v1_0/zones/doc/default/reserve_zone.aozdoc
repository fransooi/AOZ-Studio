<i>Reserve Zone</i>
<b>Reserve Zone</b> xxxxxxx
=
The RESERVE ZONE instruction must be used to allocate enough memory for the exact number of zones required,
before a SET ZONE command is given. There is no limit to the number that can be specified, apart from the amount
of available memory.

To erase all current zone definitions and restore the allocated memory to the main program, simply give the
RESERVE ZONE command without any number parameter.
