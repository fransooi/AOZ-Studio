This function will load a file previously saved with the Save Variables command, read all the
values of the variables and arrays contained in it, and assign them to the variables in your application.

Warning: the previous content of variables with the same name as the ones saved in the file will be erased.

If a variable which value is contained in the file does not exists in the current application, it will be created.
