<i>Draw Shadow</i>
<b>Draw Shadow</b> xxxxxxx
=
This instruction allows you to add a shadow to any graphics with AOZ's graphics drawing instructions. With a bit of imagination, shadow can be used to create other effects, such as add a glow to an image.
Once the shadow is set, it will be used for all subsequent text operations until it is turned off, by using 'Draw Shadow Off'.
Also, once set, individual elements of the shadow definition can be changed, such as the blur.
