This function returns the number of pixels that make up the width of the characters in the current font, in a given
string. This can vary for the same string, depending on the font in use. Furthermore, there are special fonts which
assign different widths for each character in the same character set, known as "proportional" fonts. Here is a simple
example:
@code
TS="Centred Text"
L=Text Length(T$)
Text 160-L/2,100,T$
