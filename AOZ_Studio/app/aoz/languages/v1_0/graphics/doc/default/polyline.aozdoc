<i>Polyline</i>
<b>Polyline</b> xxxxxxx
=
The POLYLINE is identical to DRAW except that it accepts multiple coordinate settings at the same time. In this
way, complex many-sided outlines can be drawn with a single statement. In its POLYLINE TO form, drawing
begins at the current graphic cursor position. For example:
@code
Circle 160,100,95
Polyline 160,6 To 100,173 To 250,69 To 71,69 To 222,173 To 160,6
@code
