<i>Ellipse</i>
<b>Ellipse</b> xxxxxxx
=
An ellipse is drawn in a similar way. After the x,y-coordinates have set the centre location, two radii must be given,
one to set the horizontal width and the second to set the height of the ellipse. Coordinates may be omitted as usual,
providing the commas remain in place. For example:
@code
