<i>Set Line</i>
<b>Set Line</b> xxxxxxx
=
This command sets the style of all straight lines that are subsequently drawn. Theoretically, the 16-bit mask can
generate values for different patterns between 0 and 65535, but here is a more practical example:
@code
Cls : Ink 2
Set Line $F0F0
Box 50,100 To 150,140
Set Line %1100110011001100
Box 60,110 To 160,160
@code
