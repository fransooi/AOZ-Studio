<i>Circle</i>
<b>Circle</b> xxxxxxx
=
To draw circles, a pair of coordinates sets the position of the centre point around which the shape is to be drawn,
followed by the radius of the circle (the distance between the centre point and the circumference or rim of the
circle.) If the x,y-coordinates are omitted, the circle will be drawn from the current graphic cursor position.For example:
@code
Cls : Curs Off : Ink 3
Gr Locate 160,100
Circle ,,45 : Wait 100: Flash Off
Do
Ink Rnd(15) : X=Rnd(250) : Y=Rnd(150) : R=Rnd(90)+1
Circle X,Y,R
Loop
@code
