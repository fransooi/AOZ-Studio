<i>Update Off</i>
<b>Update Off</b> xxxxxxx

UPDATE OFF turns off the automatic re-drawing system, so that any Bob or Sprite commands will appear to be completely ignored. In actual fact, they are still going on invisibly, in the background.
Any other graphical command (like drawing in the screens, moving or rotating them) will be preserved: Update Off only affects graphical objects.
