Use the SCREEN HIDE command to remove the current screen from view. It can then be restored using a SCREEN
SHOW instruction, like this:
@code
Cls : Print "I am the Current Screen" : Wait 100
Screen Hide : Wait Key
Screen Show
@code
Any screen can be temporarily hidden, by including its index number after the SCREEN HIDE instruction. This
screen is revealed with a similar request to SCREEN SHOW, followed by the relevant screen number.
