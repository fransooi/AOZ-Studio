This function loads a given number of characters into a string variable, waiting for the user to enter each character in
turn. Although characters will not appear on the screen, similar to INKEY$, the two instructions are totally different.

Here is an example:
@code
Clear Key : Print "Please type in ten characters"
V$=Input$(10) : Print "You typed: ";V$
@code
