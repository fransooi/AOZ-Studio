As normal memory is unaccessible on modern machines, AOZ solves the address by using the "Start" function to get the address of a bank (magical number) and adding the offset.

The COPY command is used to move large sections of memory banks from one place to another.

Specify the start and finish locations of the data to be moved, then give the destination of the position of memory
area which is to be loaded with the data.
