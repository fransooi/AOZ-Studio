<i>Poke</i>

The POKE command moves a number from 0 to 255 into the memory location at the specified address.

The address should be resolved in AOZ by using the "Start" function to get the address of a bank (magical number) and adding the offset to the address. Normal computer memory is inaccessible.

This example reserves a memory bank and poke random numbers in it...
@code
Reserve As Work 10, 1000
For A = 0 To Length( 10 )
Poke Start( 10 ) + A, Rnd( 256 )
Next
