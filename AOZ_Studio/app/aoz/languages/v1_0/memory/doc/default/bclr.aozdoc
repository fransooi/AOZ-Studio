<i>BClr</i>
<b>BClr</b> xxxxxxx

The BCLR command clears a bit by setting it to zero. The bit number can be from 0 to 31, and pinpoints the single binary digit to be cleared.

If an expression is used instead of a variable, it will be treated as an address only if AOZ can detect the "magical number" that indicate a memory bank.
