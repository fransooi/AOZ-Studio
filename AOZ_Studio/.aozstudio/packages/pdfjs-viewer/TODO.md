-   use pageView.viewport.convertToPdfPoint

***

-   fix weird problem with moving pane split
    maybe mouse events are lost in iframe? â€“ they are
    hopefully fixed soon in Atom, see
    <https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/20216>

-   option to open external links with `atom.workspace.open`
    instead of `shell.openExternal`
    or check whether browser-package is installed?

-   support for printing, but properly through system.
    why garble a perfectly fine PDF by printing it rendered at screen resolution

-   re-enable support for Retina displays in style sheet
