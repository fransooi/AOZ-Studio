# Local Web Server for Atom

Spin up a [Live-Server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) pointing at the page you're working on. The page automatically refreshes as you make changes.

## Usage

Open an HTML file and choose “Start Local Web Server” from the command palette, or press `⇧⌘E`. If the active tab isn't an HTML file, the web server will point to the root directory of your project.
