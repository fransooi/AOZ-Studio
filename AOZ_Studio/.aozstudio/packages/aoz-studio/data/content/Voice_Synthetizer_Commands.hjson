            "say":
            [
                This is one of the simplest of all AOZ Studio commands to use, and it has one of the most satisfying results.
Use the SAY instruction with a string of text, containing all the words and punctuation you want AMOS
Professional to speak, like this:
                '''
                ~~~                
		   Say "Welcome, everybody!"
                ~~~
                '''
                Normally, all other instructions, music or sound effects will wait until AOZ Studio has finished speaking
before they are executed. This default speech mode has a value of zero. By adding an optional mode value of 1,
synthetic speech can be delivered while the rest of the program is being executed. This will necessarily slow down
the relevant routines. To return to the default mode, use a line like this:
                '''
                ~~~                
		   Say "Default mode.,0
                ~~~
                '''
                Now get AOZ Studio to say anything you like, using the next simple routine, but please mind your language!
Try experimenting with numbers and symbol characters too.
                '''
                ~~~                
		   Do
		  	Input "Please tell me what to say:;S$
		  	S$=S$+".
		   	Say S$
		   Loop
                ~~~
                '''
If the Narrator system appears to fumble over a particular phrase, you are free to clarify things by adding spaces at
the end of a sentence, or using phonetic spellings. As always, you cannot do any harm by experimenting.

            "say_talk": //TODO
            [
                
                '''
                ~~~                

                ~~~
                '''
            ]
            "talk_misc":
            [
                Existing AMOS users will find that the AOZ Studio speech facilities have been augmented and improved.
The TALK MISC command allows you to set the volume and frequency of the narrator voice used for SAY
instructions.
""
Synthetic speech can be delivered from a whisper to a shout, by setting the volume parameter between zero for
silence, up to 64 for full volume. Frequency is directly adjusted by setting a value from 5000 to 25000, with some
superb effects being generated at slower frequencies. Note that the higher the frequency setting, the more processor
time will be taken in multitask mode.

Try this example:
                '''
                ~~~                
		   For V=16 To 64 Step 8
		   	For F=5000 To 25000 Step 5000
		   	   Talk Misc V,F
			   SAY "I think therefore I AMOS!"
			Next F
		   Next V
                ~~~
                '''
            ]
            "talk_stop":
            [
                This simple command is used to terminate synthetic speech delivered by a SAY instruction, while in multitask
mode.

            ]
            "mouth_read":
            [
                This function waits for a mouth movement, and then reads the new mouth values directly into the MOUTH WIDTH
and MOUTH HEIGHT functions, as demonstrated by the usual ready- made example program.Â£
            ]
            "mouth_width":
            [
                MOUTH WIDTH reports the width of the mouth at any instant, in pixels. This function will return a negative value
if the current speech has finished.
            ]
            "mouth_height":
            [
                Similarly to MOUTH WIDTH, a negative value is returned if the speech is over, otherwise the current height of the
mouth is given in pixels.
